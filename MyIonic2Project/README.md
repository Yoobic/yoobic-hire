### SPECS

1. *Sign-in*: landing page is set to sign-in. Has pseudo functionality (as only one user exists: `user: admin@admin.com, password: 1234`). If any other user tries to login, alert pops up. `Signup` button will redirect to Register page (no functionality there)
2. *Menu*: menu does not appear until user is logged in.
3. *Master List*: communicates with Marvel API to load a random list of Marvel characters (each time `Master List` is clicked)
4. *Detail*: shows detail of character selected with back button to return to `Master List`
5. *Chat (Bonus)*: page listed is a dummy page, leads back to Dashboard page
