# YOOBIC London Dev Hiring Project 2
## The goal
Welcome to the second exercise. 

At YOOBIC we use a design system which we have made using Stencil JS ( https://stenciljs.com/ ). That means we have components for everything (over 250 of them!), from a basic button or an icon all the way up to very complex components like the login page. One of our most used components is the grid, which at the very basic level, takes an array of data and displays it as a list in the correct way for that type of data.

We want you to make a simplified version of this grid. The data you use does not matter, you can use the data from the previous exercise. 

## The Spec
- Create a component using Stencil JS that takes an array of data as an input and displays it as a list.


Thats it! We don't want you spending a whole weekend on this project, we are not testing you on your design skills. We understand that is very unlikely you will have used Stencil JS before so we want to see how well you can learn a new technology and use a design system approach to the task.
